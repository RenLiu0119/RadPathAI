# Deep Learning-Based Image Classification for Integrating Pathology and Radiology in AI-Assisted Medical Imaging

## Abstract

The integration of pathology and radiology in medical imaging has emerged as a critical need for advancing diagnostic accuracy and improving clinical workflows. Current AI-driven approaches for medical image analysis, despite significant progress, face several challenges, including handling multi-modal imaging, imbalanced datasets, and the lack of robust interpretability and uncertainty quantification. These limitations often hinder the deployment of AI systems in real-world clinical settings, where reliability and adaptability are essential. 

To address these issues, this study introduces a novel framework, the Domain-Informed Adaptive Network (DIANet), combined with an Adaptive Clinical Workflow Integration (ACWI) strategy. DIANet leverages multi-scale feature extraction, domain-specific priors, and Bayesian uncertainty modeling to enhance interpretability and robustness. The proposed model is tailored for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, integrating adaptive learning mechanisms to mitigate domain shifts and imbalanced datasets. Complementing the model, the ACWI strategy ensures seamless deployment through explainable AI (XAI) techniques, uncertainty-aware decision support, and modular workflow integration compatible with clinical systems like PACS. 

Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, segmentation precision, and reconstruction fidelity across diverse imaging modalities, validating the potential of this framework to bridge the gap between AI innovation and clinical utility.
